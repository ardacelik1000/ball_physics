# Physics Simulation and Ball Game using Pygame

This Python code implements a simple physics simulation and ball game using the Pygame library. This game allows multiple balls to move on the screen and interact with each other. It includes the following features:

- Balls falling under the influence of gravity and bouncing off the ground
- Elastic collisions with walls and each other
- Selecting and dragging balls with the mouse
- Generating ball movement using velocity vectors obtained from mouse movements

The code defines the behavior and properties of each ball using the Ball class. It also includes functions to draw wall lines and control collisions.

Features of the Code:
- Ball class: Defines the behavior and properties of the balls.
- WallBorder function: Draws walls at the edges of the screen.
- CalculationMotionVector function: Calculates velocity vectors obtained from mouse movements.
- CheckCollision function: Controls collisions between balls.
- Main loop: Executes the main loop of the game and handles user interactions.

This code provides an example of a simple physics simulation and an interactive game, offering basic graphical interface using Pygame.
